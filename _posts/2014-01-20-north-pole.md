title: North Pole for Pebble Watch 
---

I've been working on an app for the Pebble Watch: a compass and an altimeter for hiking, reading maps or other outdoor activities.

You will be able to [download the app in the Pebble App Store](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/applications/52b16d566c239f90a1000001) (right now on BETA).

I also made the source available. You can [find it on Github](https://github.com/iOSCowboy/NorthPole).
