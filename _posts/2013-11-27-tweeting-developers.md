title: Tweeting Developers 
---

For a long time I saw Twitter as a source of mild entertainment which occasionally brought me up to update on something relevant.

But that point of view changed recently, when I cherry-picked who I'm following and discovered the interaction I can have with some great developers.

In no time it became a valuable tool that updates me on what's happening in my tech niche, tips me about new interesting things to learn and puts me in touch with other cool people doing cool stuff.

But don't take my word for granted. Leif Singer (@[lsinger](https://twitter.com/lsinger)), a mad scientist from the University of Victoria in Canada, made a thorough research on *How Software Developers Use Twitter*. 

He wrote a great post about it on his blog that I just can't recommend enough. It includes a tl;dr and usage strategies for developers using Twitter. Pure gold.
