title: Podcast: This Developer's Life
---

For this week I would like to recommend a podcast that I've been enjoying during this winter: [This Developer's Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com). 

It's not an overly technical podcast discussing the headers of some C library or obscure specs of certain compiler on certain platform. 

Rather than that, Rob Conery and Scott Hanselman -- the hosts  -- explore all the interesting topics around 'life as a developer': education, taking criticism, fame, getting fired, etc. 

Every show is accompanied by lots of interviews with awesome developers  and a wonderful soundtrack used cleverly to round-up all the ideas of each show.

If you are the kind of developer that 'asks lots of questions' (you should be), enjoyed *The Wonder Years* or are simply prone to introspection, you are definitively gonna enjoy it.
