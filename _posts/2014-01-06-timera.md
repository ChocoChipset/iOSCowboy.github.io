title: Timera for iPhone
---

Aren't you annoyed by the lack of a timer on the iPhone's camera?

I am, so I developed one.

Along with [Justyna Marczewska](http://justynamarczewska.com) (awesome designer from Warsaw), we created a camera timer app with a simple interface and a great user experience.

It's name is Timera (camera + timer) and it's [available for free in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timera/id775995943?mt=8). 

Go and get it!!
