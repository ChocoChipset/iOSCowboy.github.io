title: Command that Terminal 
---

As I grow older I found myself more and more comfortable working from the OSX Terminal.
I was annoyed however by the "lack of commands to navigate through the text and make life easier" until I discovered them recently and my mind was blown. 
In case somebody else is using the left and right arrows to navigate through typed commands, I've compiled a list of useful commands for the Terminal:

* ```Ctrl + A```: Go to the beginning of the line.
* ```Ctrl + E```: Go to the end of line.

* ```Ctrl + F```: Move the cursor position one space forward.
* ```Ctrl + B```: Move the cursor position one space backward.
* ```Alt + F```: Move the cursor position one word forward.
* ```Alt + B```: Move the cursor position one word backward.

* ```Ctrl + U```: Clear the line before the cursor.
* ```Ctrl + K```: Clear the line after the cursor.
* ```Alt + Del```: Delete the word before the cursor.
* ```Alt + D```: Delete the word after the cursor.

* ```Tab```: Auto-complete file and directory names.

* ```Ctrl + L```: Clears the screen (same result as typing the ```clear``` command).

* ```Ctrl + C```: Terminate the running program; a timeless classic.
