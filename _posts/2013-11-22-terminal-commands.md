title: Command that Terminal 
---

In case somebody else is using the left and right arrows to navigate through typed commands, I've compiled a list of useful shortcuts for the Terminal:

* ```Ctrl + A```: Go to the beginning of the line.
* ```Ctrl + E```: Go to the **e**nd of line.
* ```Ctrl + F```: Move the cursor position one space **f**orward.
* ```Ctrl + B```: Move the cursor position one space **b**ackward.
* ```Alt + F```: Move the cursor position one word **f**orward.
* ```Alt + B```: Move the cursor position one word **b**ackward.
* ```Ctrl + U```: Clear the line before the cursor.
* ```Ctrl + K```: Clear the line after the cursor.
* ```Alt + Del```: **Delete** the word before the cursor.
* ```Alt + D```: **D**elete the word after the cursor.
* ```Tab```: Auto-complete file and directory names.
* ```Ctrl + L```: **Cl**ears the screen (same result as typing the ```clear``` command).
* ```Ctrl + C```: Terminate the running program; a timeless classic.

As I grow older I found myself more and more comfortable working from the OSX Terminal, but I was annoyed by the "missing commands to navigate through the text"... 
Until I discovered them recently and my mind was blown. 

Hope they are useful for somebody else too.
