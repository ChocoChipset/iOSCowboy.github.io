Long time no see! 

I've been quite busy for the last two months: little bit of traveling followed by my first month at Spotify. So far, so good. I'm already tinkering the iOS codebase and contributing to make Browse on iOS even more awesome.

Hopefully, I'll return to my weekly writing next week. Stay tuned! I got a neat experiment around Bluetooth Low Energy that I want to share with you.
