title: Software Engineering Radio 
---

During the last few weeks, while commuting, I've been ditching music in favor of podcasts about software and programming.

[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net) is one of my new favorites. It includes interviews with experts on hot topics like open source development or data visualization, while other episodes bring experienced points of view about classic topics like continuous integration, refactoring and so on.

It might be a little too stiff or academic for some listeners, but I definitively recommend it to any software engineer out there.
