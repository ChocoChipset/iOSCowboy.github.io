hello world!

My name is Hector Zarate. I'm an Software Engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden currently working for Spotify. 

I've been focused on iOS development for the last few years. I've worked on all size of companies all over the world and I'm occassionaly a speaker at conferences or Meetups on the topic.

I'm also in the search for the perfect chocolate bar.
