title: Using a hardware controller in your debugger
---

Back when I was active recording my own music ([SoundCloud in case you are curious](https://soundcloud.com/yuniper), I always used a hardware knob to navigate and control Logic.

It was a very simple device ([a knob which is also a big button]((http://griffintechnology.com/powermate)) but incredibly useful. So I thought: if it was so wonderful with music software, perhaps it can make an IDE suck less. 

The problem that I wanted to solve was the constant switching between clicking the simulator (or taping a real device) and typing the common two-handed shortcuts  you need while debugging in Xcode: Pause, Step Over, Step Into, etc. 

I browsed MIDI controllers and video control surfaces, and bought a Shuttle-Xpress after a little research. It's small,  inexpensive and comes with a dial and more than enough buttons. 

Next thing was just to configure my most used shortcuts and tune a little bit that configuration after some use. This is the layout that I'm using right now.

Definitively worth it! 

It's probably not as powerful as with video or music software, but it makes debugging a little more comfortable. Lots of the debugger commands for Xcode require two hands to be typed and, in the case of an iOS developer, you will be using one of them to hold the device or to operate the simulator. 

Of course, you could also set different shortcuts, but a) lots of them are already taken and b) if I really wanted to stretch my hands, I would instead try to play something composed by Rachmaninoff.
